This is a bank comand line interface code developed using python programming language and SQL. It includes the basic features required in a bank. There is an open account system, a change of pin system, a deposit system and a withrawal system.
All the aforementioned systems are easy to operate as there are prompts available to guide the user.
The aim of this progam are as follows; 
    1. Register and maintain Customer details.
    2. Update account balance through deposits and withdrawals.
I have programmed the basic functionalities, and now i will very much appreciate any kind of feedback, either code specific feedback or feedback on my general coding.
